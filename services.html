	<h1>Screen Printing / Customizations</h1>
	<p> We offer in-house screen printing, graphic design, and jersey name and number customization. We use Union and Wilflex inks that are phthalate free. Standard turn-around on screen printed orders is 7-10 business days from art approval. Standard turn-around for adding names and heat applied lettering is 3-5 days. To start the design process please check out the Design Studio link on our page, or shoot us an email with your ideas.</p>
  <h1>Tackle Twill Lettering</h1>
  <p>One of the most traditional and durable ways to decorate uniforms is sewn on tackle twill lettering.  We offer custom logos, team names, individual player names, and multiple styles of numbers. We can also enhance your jersey tops and pants by adding decoration such as soutache, braid, and trim to existing uniforms. </p>
  <h1>Embroidery</h1>
	<p> We can take care of everything from custom caps from Richardson Cap, Pacific Headwear, The Game, Pukka and New Era. We can make coaches look just as sharp as the players in matching polos and jackets. We offer a large selection of spirit apparel as well that can be embroidered to match for a unified look.
      <br><br>
      Some of the many options for decorating garments and hats with embroidery,  include raised 3-D lettering, locker tags, and additional locations such as the sides and backs of hats.
      <br><br>
      To work on creating a custom cap please visit out Uniform Builder page to connect with links to cap builders for these quality brands.</p>
  <h1>Equipment</h1>
  <p>As one of the largest stocking dealers in the Pacific Northwest, chances are you can walk in and find what you need. We stock everything from bats and balls, to blocking dummies, and field equipment. We are open with dozens of vendors, and if by chance we don't have it on our shelves, we most likely can get it in just a few  days.
     <br><br>
     A few of the vendors that we are open with include: Adams, Bison, Demarini, Easton, The Game, Holloway, Juggs, Nokona, Spalding, Richardson Cap Co, Rippon, Wilson, Rawlings, Stackhouse, and many more. </p>
